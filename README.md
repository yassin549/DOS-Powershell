# **DOS Shell with Integrated Text Editor**

## **Overview**  

This project is a custom **DOS Shell** with a built-in **text editor**, developed as the final project for the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course at the **University of Engineering and Technology**. It leverages key data structures like **trees** and **doubly linked lists** to simulate file system navigation and efficient file operations.  

The application provides a robust command-line interface (CLI) combined with text editing functionality, making it a powerful and practical tool for educational purposes.

## **Key Features**

### **1. DOS Shell Interface**  
A command-line interface mimicking the DOS shell, enabling:  
- Directory navigation.  
- File creation and deletion.  
- Execution of familiar commands like `cd`, `ls`, and `mkdir`.  

### **2. Integrated Text Editor**  
A versatile text editor that supports:  
- Creating, editing, and saving text files.  
- Command-based text manipulation for a seamless user experience.

### **3. File System with Tree Data Structure**  
The file system is implemented using a **tree data structure**, offering:  
- Efficient navigation.  
- Dynamic file and directory management.  

### **4. Doubly Linked Lists for Directory Management**  
Utilizes **doubly linked lists** for:  
- Quick access and manipulation of directory contents.  
- Enhanced performance for file traversal operations.  

### **5. User-Friendly and Performant**  
- Familiar command syntax for easy adoption.  
- Optimized algorithms ensure smooth performance.
